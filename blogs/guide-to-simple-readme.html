        In an open-source world, the importance of public cloud version control
        is a boon. As most might agree, Github (or any ecosystem of git) has
        played an important part in the Tech industry. Contribution to open
        source has kept the tech growing in a direction of continuous
        improvement with seamless collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        This said, it's our responsibility to well document our contributions,
        and the Readme markdown file (readme.md) is the face of our repository.
        Through this blog, I will try to give a guide to write a simple but
        effective readme document.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>

      <p>
        Because it's the first thing people would look at when they come into
        your repo. (Like said - <i>First impressions are important!</i> ) People lookout
        for this file to get a brief of what your repo would be doing and how
        they can utilize it. And if you are trying to showcase your work, and
        want more audience, be sure to put a lot of thought into this file
      </p>

      <h3>How did I come up with these?</h3>

      <p>
        As always, <i>observe the best!</i> I've gone through several repos
        which are trending, highest starred, and most spoken about. From these,
        I have collected a few common but very important pointers which I'm
        going to discuss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before I start, I have two sets of contents which I will share, one -
        these pointers are basic and I would highly recommend to "MUST HAVE" in
        your repos two - these are good to have and will make your repos look
        much better
      </p>

      <h3>Straight to the MUST HAVE in the readme file</h3>

      <b>Title</b>
      <p>
        A good title in big and bold fonts will help the reader have it in mind.
        Try to keep the name much user-friendly and short (Not very vague
        either).
      </p>

      <b>Description</b>
      <p>
        This would be a very important part of your readme. It should
        potentially try to explain your software's most important aspects. (what
        problem it is solving) Try to keep these sections away from took much of
        technical terms which the user might feel overwhelmed. (Not if your
        software is a very specific pick) It should not be very long but concise
        enough to express your thoughts. It's also good to highlight some of
        your key features in this section.
      </p>

      <b> Tech stack </b>
      <p>
        As the user is most likely to look out for using your code, it would be
        best to describe your tech stack. It enables the user to analyze the
        usability of their ecosystem. Also, this will invite interested people
        to go deeper into the code.
      </p>

      <b>Installation / Usage guide </b>
      <p>
        Once the user is interested to try out your work, you should give clear
        and precise steps involved to use your work. This would involve details
        about setting up the dev environment (All the things needed for your
        software to work) Installation steps with code snippets if necessary and
        A brief walkthrough of how to consume your features.
      </p>

      <h3>Now, the good to have features</h3>

      <b>Pics/ gifs/ screenshots</b>
      <p>
        As title, these are somethings that you must try to include so that it
        remains in the user's mind for a much longer duration.        
      </p>  
      It might include:    
      <ul style="margin-left: 1rem;">
        <li>Pictures of your end product</li>
        <li>Gifs of your most attractive features</li>
        <li>Or at least screenshots of your various product pages</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Credits</b>
      <p>
        In most of the cases we would have people/projects whose presence made
        your product much better than where it started. Although open-source
        it's a very good humane thing to call out and appreciate people's
        efforts
      </p>

      <b>Contribution</b>
      <p>
        this section, you will have to lay down the guidelines in which you
        would like the contributions to be done to the repo. Or also if you are
        not open to any contributions at that particular point in time, it is
        good to mention and save the efforts of very open-hearted contributors.
      </p>

      <b>Copyright and license</b>
      <p>
        If your product is particularly has a restricted usage policy, make sure
        you highlight them clearly in this section. There are a list of readily
        available license templates available for usage
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
        Writing a readme would take very less time compared to building your
        project but has a lot of value and impact on its usage. Let's be wise
        and responsible while pushing code to the world.
