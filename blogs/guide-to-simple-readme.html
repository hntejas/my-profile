        In an open source world the importance of a public cloud version control is a boon.
As most might agree, Github (or any ecosystem of git) has played an important part in the Tech industry. 
Contribution to open source has kept the tech growing in a direction of continous improvement with seemless colaboration. 

This said, it's our responsibility to well document our contributions, and the Readme mark down file (readme.md) is the face of our respository.
Through this blog I will try to give a guide to write a simple but effective readme file.

Why is it so important?

Because it's the first thing people would look when they come into your repo. (Like said - First impressions are important!)
People look out for this file to get a brief of what your repo would be doing and how they can utilize it.
And if you are trying to showcase your work, and want more audience, be sure to put lot of thought into this file

How did I come up with these?

As always, observe the best! I've gone through several repos which are trending, highest starred and most spoken about.
From these I've have collected few common but very important pointers which I'm going to discuss.

Before I start, I have two sets of contents which I will share, one - these pointers are basic and I would highly recommend to "MUST HAVE" in your repos
two - these are good to have and will make your repos look much better

Straight to the MUST HAVE in the readme file

1) Title - A good title in big and bold fonts will help the reader have it in mind. Try to keep the name much userfriendly and short (Not very vague either).

2) Description - This would be a very important part of your readme. It should potentially try to explain your software's most important aspects. (what problem it is solving)
Try to keep this sections away from took much of technical terms which the user might feel overwelmed. (Not if your software is a very specific pick)
It should not be very long but consise enough to express your thoughts. It's also good to highlight some of your key features in this section.

3) Tech stack - As the user is most likely to look out for using your code, it would be best to describe your tech stack. It enables the user to analize the usability into their ecosystem. 
Also this will invite intrested people go deeper into the code. 

4) Installation/usage guide - Once the user is interested to try out your work, you should give clear and precise steps involved to use your work. 
This would involve details about setting up the dev environment (All the things needed for your software to work)
Installation steps with code snippets if necessary and A brief walkthrough of how to consume your features. 

Now, the good to have features - 

1) Pics/gifs/screenshots - As title, these are somethings that you must try to include so that it retains in the users mind for a much longer duration.
It might include pictures of your end product 
Gifs of your most attractive features
Or atleast screenshots of your various product pages 

2) Credits - In most of the cases we would have people/projects who's presence made your product much better than where it started. 
Although open source it's a very good humane thing to call out and appreciate people's efforts 

3) Contribution - In this section, you will have to lay down the guidelines in which you would like the contributions be done to repo.
Or also if you are not open to any contributions at that particular point of time, it is good to mention and save efforts of very open hearted contributors. 

4) Copyright and license - If your product is particularly has a restricted usage policy, make sure you highlight them clearly in this section. 
There are list of readly available license templates available for usage

Conclusion: 

Writing a readme would take very less time compared to the building your project but has lot value and impact on it's usage. Let's wise and responsible while pushing code to the world.
