# Hey there! Tejas here

Welcome to my profile. I've built this portfolio website to share my work and knowledge with all of you. 

## Short Intro:

I'm a software dev with 3 years of professional experience.

Majority of my work is around ERP development which involved working on customizing and building scripts using Suitescript (An Javascript library) built for Oracle Netsuite ERP. 

I also have worked on front-end development using BackboneJS focusing towards e-commerce website development with Suitecommerce Advanced (An integrated e-commerce store for Netsuite ERP)

As a curious dev, I love to keep learning things around the JS ecosystem. I have tried explore areas like React, Redux, Express, Node, WebRTC etc. 

Ops! it went long, to know more about me I would suggest you to take a look at my [portfolio website](https://tejas-dev.netlify.app/).
